/**
 * The abstract base class for all C++ proxy objects generated for java.
 * These proxy classes are a C++ representation of a java class reference.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In addition to the rules in the JValue class, JObject's must
 * also adhere to the following set of rules:
 *
 * - All JObject's must be constructable from a JNI jobject.
 *   For example: String::String(jobject).
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * JObjects may be created from existing jobjects, or they may
 * create new jobjects.
 *
 * For example, the code:
 * {
 *   String foo(java_new<String>());
 * }
 *
 * creates a new java.lang.String through JNI and assigns it to a reference called "foo".
 *
 * Whereas the code:
 *
 * Java_com_foo_bar(jobject this, jstring aString)
 * {
 *   String foo(aString);
 * }
 *
 * does not create a new java.lang.String, but simply creates a reference to an
 * existing java.lang.String.
 *
 * In both cases, String creates a global reference to the jstring,
 * and does not release that global reference until it's lifetime
 * has ended.
